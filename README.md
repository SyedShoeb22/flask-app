# Image and Video Processing API
This API allows for the processing of images and videos to improve their quality, reduce noise, or add special effects. It can be used in the entertainment industry, photography, and other areas where image and video processing is important.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Requests

Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

'''
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/image-video-processing-api.git
'''
Navigate to the project directory:

'''
cd image-video-processing-api
'''
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

'''
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
'''
Install the required packages:

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
Running the API
To run the API locally, use the following command:

'''
python app.py
'''
The API will be running on http://localhost:5000/

# Usage
To process an image, make a POST request to http://localhost:5000/process_image with the following JSON data:

'''
{
    "image_url": "IMAGE_URL"
}
'''
Replace IMAGE_URL with the url of the image you want to process.

The API will return the processed image in the form of bytes.

# Built With
- Flask - The web framework used
- OpenCV - Used for image and video processing
[Requests](https://
requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve image from URL

# Acknowledgements
Inspiration for this project came from the potential use cases for image and video processing in various industries.
The image processing code is based on the fastNlMeansDenoisingColored function from OpenCV.
Deployment
You can deploy this API to a cloud service such as Google App Engine or Heroku for production use.
Please follow the instructions provided by the respective platforms on how to deploy a Flask application.

# Future Work
This is a basic implementation of image processing using OpenCV. In future versions, more advanced image processing techniques such as object detection and image segmentation can be added to the API.
